#### _Restaurant Reviews Project_

## Project Overview

The provided site was modified to use a responsive design.
This was achieved using Flexbox, media queries and responsive images.

Accessibility features were implemented in the site HTML (most of this HTML is generated by JavaScript functions).

Additionaly, a ServiceWorker script was used to cache requests to all of the site’s assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline.
Only caching was implemented, no other ServiceWorker features.

### Specification

The code for a restaurant reviews website was provided which had a lot of issues.
It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less on a mobile device.
It also didn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it didn’t work offline at all.
The job was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### How to run this webapp?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.
Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python.
For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`.
If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use).
For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.
If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
`<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` was replaced with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
As much as possible, the use of ES6 was maintained in additional JavaScript witten.
